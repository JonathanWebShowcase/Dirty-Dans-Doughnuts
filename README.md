# Project Overview

This project showcases my front-end development skills, focusing on creating interactive websites with live feedback based on user interactions and timed events. Additionally, I demonstrated my expertise in JavaScript by manipulating data using local and session storage. The project also highlights my creativity, incorporating self-drawn images and animations created with Adobe Creative Suite software.

## Process

I built a dynamic front-end experience with real-time feedback mechanisms. JavaScript was used to handle user interactions and manage timed events, ensuring seamless responses to user inputs. Local and session storage were employed to store and retrieve client-side data, enabling a personalized experience. This required careful handling of data loops and validation. For the visual aspects, I created original artwork and animations using Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Animate, integrating these elements to enhance the user experience.

## Challenges and Solutions

Key challenges included managing data loops and validation in JavaScript, which led to bugs and errors. These issues were resolved through rigorous debugging and testing. Integrating custom images and animations required aligning technical implementation with creative design. Adobe Creative Suite tools were used to create and optimize these elements, ensuring they complemented the interactive features of the website.

## Lessons Learned

This project emphasized the importance of thorough testing and debugging in front-end development, particularly with client-side data storage and real-time feedback. It also reinforced the value of combining technical skills with creative design, demonstrating how self-drawn images and animations can enhance user engagement. The experience highlighted my ability to tackle complex challenges and deliver a polished, interactive web experience.

## Conclusion

The project effectively demonstrated my front-end development skills and creativity. By creating an interactive, data-driven website with personalized user experiences, integrating custom graphics and animations, and overcoming technical challenges, I showcased both my technical proficiency and artistic flair. This assignment reinforced my dedication to delivering high-quality work and my readiness to address and resolve development challenges.
